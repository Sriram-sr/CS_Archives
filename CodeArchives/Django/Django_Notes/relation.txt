Django relationships 

models.ForeignKey("anyModel")
  that any model is a parent table and field having this is a child model

eg. class User:
        username = charfield
        
    class Room:
        host = models.Foreignkey(User,on_delete..)

Room's host may be any of the User
A user can have many rooms (So one to many)

Many To Many:

class Course:
    name = models.charfield()

class Student:
    course = models.ManytoManyField() 

This shows that any course can be enrolled by any student
a course can have any student
