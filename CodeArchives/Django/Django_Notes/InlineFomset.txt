from django.forms import inlineformset_factory

this is used to create inlne form set (multiple sets of forms)
suppose there is customer model
there is Order model which has a field 'customer' which foreignkey(1toM) relationship to customer model
(Many customers can place a order)

from models import Customer,Order
OrderFormSet = inlineformset_factory(Customer,Order,fields=('product','status'),extra=10) # the fields are from order table
# extra=10 10 formsets will be displayed 
# anyVarname = inlineformset_factory(Parentmodel,Child,fields) 
customer = Customer.objects.get(id=3)
orderform = OrderFormSet(instance=customer)
this will grab Order objects made with current customer and displays in html when you render
fields you mentiomed will be displayed for each customer's object and extra three forms will be displayed(That is the advantage
of inline formset)
