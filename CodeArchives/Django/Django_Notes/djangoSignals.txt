To perform functions using django signals

from django.db.models.signals import post_save,post_delete

so you want to create a profile for every newly created user

class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200, blank=True, null=True)
    username = models.CharField(max_length=200, blank=True, null=True)
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=200, blank=True, null=True)

This is profile model to be created

write a custom function for creating profile

def createprofile(sender,instance,created,**kwargs):  #sender is sending model,instance is model object created is True if created false if edited.
   profile = Profile.create(
                 user = instance,
                 name = instance.username,
                 email = instance.email
              )

post_save.connect(createprofile, sender=User)
this will create a profile as the method and sending model specified
