In manage.py shell if you use auth user model you can change password with
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

user = User.objects.get(username=<username>)
user.set_password(<new_password>)
user.save()

This will  set new password for user

 In jinja tags when you get receive a key from views like
{'text':hello world}  if you receive in template as {{text|title}} will return as 'Hello World'
  as it just capitalises

You can redirect to a link using jinja tags 
<a href="{% url 'name_you_given' arg %}">click_to_redirect</a>
This is like redirecting the page but you have to use the name that you specify in path('')

when sending a json response you can add safe=False parameter to pass other than dictionaries
mylist = [
     'api/home/',
     'api/rooms/'
     ]

eg.  return JsonResponse(mylist,safe=False)

auto_now_add option will get the time when object is created
auto_now will gets updated every time updated
